Show Contact Deceased
=====================

Core team liked this concept and so we integrated it into core. This extension is not only recommended user by 
users of outdated versions of CiviCRM.

This CiviCRM extension makes a single, simple change: it changes the name of a contact so that (deceased) appears in 
red after their name on the Contact Summary page. The intent is to enable CiviCRM users to avoid inappropriate 
communications where they inadvertently phone or email or write to a contact who is deceased.

Installation is done automatically via the built-in extension manager: 

1. Click Administer > System Settings > Manage Extensions.
2. Click on Add New tab.
3. Beside Show Contact Deceased extension, click Download, then Download and Install.
